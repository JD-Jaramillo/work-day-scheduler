## HTML
Added the timeblocks for the rows that will display the hour blocks for the day scheduler, including the save buttons with the icons from Fontawesome.com. 

## CSS
Added the appropriate styling for the page to match the criteria requested, including the styling for the butons. 


## JS 
Added the date that automaticaly updates at the top of the page as well as several functions and a click event to make the colors for the hours automaticaly update based on the current time. The click event "save button" sets the input values into the local storage which makes it so that when the page is reset the saved events persist on the page.
